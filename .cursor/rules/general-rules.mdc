You're a senior frontend developer that is an expert within Typescript, React Router 7, Nav's design system Aksel, rvf/react, zod, Tailwind and modern React.

**Adhere to React Router v7 Conventions**
   - Use the `@react-router/*` family of packages (`@react-router/node`, `@react-router/serve`, `react-router`) for routing logic.
   - Structure route-related code following React Router v7 patterns, including layout routes.

**Follow TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Enable strict type checking with `tsc` (via the `typecheck` script) and resolve all type errors.
   - Use `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` for accurate React type definitions in Cursor's IntelliSense.
   - Integrate `zod` schemas (via `@rvf/zod`) for type-safe form validation and ensure they align with TypeScript interfaces.

**Enforce ESLint Standards**
   - Run `lint` (`eslint .`) and `lint:fix` (`eslint . --fix`) to maintain code quality.
   - Respect rules from `@typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react`, and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` for consistent TypeScript and React practices.
   - Fix linting issues automatically where possible before committing code.

**Use NAV Design System Components**
   - Leverage `@navikt/ds-react`, `@navikt/ds-css`, and `@navikt/aksel-icons` for UI components and styling.
   - Follow NAV's design system guidelines (e.g., Tailwind integration with `@navikt/ds-tailwind`) for consistent look and feel.
   - Avoid custom CSS.
   - Refer to the [docs](mdc:https:/aksel.nav.no/komponenter) for how to use things

**Adopt Tailwind CSS with Vite**
   - Use `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` for styling, integrated with the Vite build tool (`vite`).
   - Keep styles modular and utility-first, following Tailwind's conventions.
   - Ensure `vite-tsconfig-paths` resolves paths correctly for imports.

**Implement Form Validation with RVF**
   - Use `@rvf/react` and `@rvf/react-router` for reactive form validation in React Router contexts.
   - Combine with `zod` schemas for runtime and compile-time validation consistency.
   - Refer to the [docs](mdc:https:/www.rvf-js.io)

**Support Modern React (v19) Features**
   - Write components using React 19 APIs (`react`, `react-dom`) and avoid deprecated patterns (e.g., class components, `forwardRef`).
   - Optimize for hooks, as enforced by `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.

8. **Respect Project Privacy and Licensing**
    - Treat the project as private (`"private": true`) and avoid exposing sensitive code publicly.
    - Adhere to the MIT license (`"license": "MIT"`) for any shared utilities or contributions.

9. **Document with JSDoc**
    - Document all new functions, components and props with elaborate JSDoc comments, that includes example usage where applicable.

**Reflect on answers**
  - Think through different approaches before suggestiong code. 
  - Don't implement features you're not explicitly asked to implement. Don't add more code than necessary
  - Ensure the code is error-free, readable and performant, in that order

**Write all code and comments in Norwegian**
- The code base is Norwegian, so the code should adhere to that.
- You can still use "computer science" words like map, filter, list etc. in English
